# Fantasy-Sports
Uses Encog Neural Networks for the player models and Genetic Algorithms to select optimal teams for Fantasy NBA.

This was thrown together sometime in late 2015.  The player models will have to be rebuilt.  I may update this in the future using something like XGBoost.  I personally think you need more than just player stats (i.e. somebody that watches NBA regularly) to create winning Fantasy teams, as the scores are very much dependant on variables beyond historic performance.  That said, it might be useful for [stacking](https://www.gamblingsites.com/daily-fantasy-sports/football/stacking/) multiple teams around a few key players you've studied closely and expect to perform well.
